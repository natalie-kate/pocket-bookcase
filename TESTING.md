## Automated Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   ## [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) 

    ### Initial testing
    - index.html

    ![Initial index.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/index-html.png)

    - about.html

    ![Initial about.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/about-html.png)

    - contact.html

     ![Initial contact.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/contact-html.png)

     I was getting warnings for using aria-checked on my radio buttons, I googled it and seems common practice to do so and couldn't see an alternative so I left them in.
  
    - edit-account.html

     ![Initial edit-account.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/edit-account-html.png)

    - edit-user.html

     ![Initial edit-user.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/initial-edit-user.png)

     Had an extra closing div and form tag so removed them.

    - manage-genres.html

     ![Initial manage-genres.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/initial-manage-genres.png)

     Had misplaced a " and so this was causing some issues, put in the correct place. Duplicate id error was coming from forgetting that a list was getting iterated and so numerous genres were getting the same id. So changed to what I had done in other pages and made the id's the genre names.

    - manage-users.html

     ![Initial manage-users.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/initial-manage-users.png)

     Hadn't left a space after an attribute which due to iteration meant numerous lines were missing a space.

    - profile.html

     ![Initial profile.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/initial-profile-html.png)

     Had two divs for each of the profile bookshelves as the same id. These were the books and if there weren't any the link to the library. As they wouldn't both get shown at the same time it hadn't occurred to me that it would be an issue. Put both divs in one div with conditions to dictate which got shown when the collapsible was toggled.

    - profile-add.html

     ![Initial profile-add.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/profile-add.png)

    - register.html

     ![Initial register.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/register-html.png)

    - sign-in.html

     ![Initial sign-in.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/sign-in-html.png)

    - edit-book.html

     ![Initial edit-book.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/update-book-html.png)

     Same issue as contact.html, with the aria-checked attribute.

    - add-book.html

     ![Initial add-book.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/add-book-html.png)

     Same issue as contact.html, with the aria-checked attribute.

    - 404.html

     ![Initial 404.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/404-html.png)

    - 500.html

      Issues raised by inputting the 500.html code was due to the templating language and therefore raised errors of needing a head, doctype, language etc.
    
    ### Final testing (for those that needed fixed)

    - manage-genres.html
    
     ![Final manage-genres.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/manage-genres-html.png)

   - manage-users.html
    
     ![Final manage-users.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/manage-users-html.png)

   - profile.html
    
     ![Final profile.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/profile-html.png)

   - edit-user.html
    
     ![Initial edit-user.html test](static/images/testing-images/validations/edit-user-html.png)


-   ## [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 
    
    ### Initial testing

      ![Initial css test](static/images/testing-images/validations/initial-css.png)

      Changed padding to 0 from none. Also changed border-color to match the other buttons.

    ### Final testing

      ![css test](static/images/testing-images/validations/css.png)
    

-   ## [JSHint JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com/) 
    
    ### Initial/final testing
  
    - contact.js

      ![Initial contact javascript test](static/images/testing-images/validations/contactjs.png)

      Errors raised was undefined variables EmailJS and $. These didn't need defined as $ is for jquery and emailjs is an external API.

## Testing User Stories 

   - #### First Time Visitor 

      1. As a first time visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.<br>
        The words bookcase and library are on the home page aswell as five books. There is also a nav link to the About page in the menu whch explains how to use the app.

         ![app menu](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/menu.png)
         
      2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to intuitively use the site.<br>
         I have put social links and other useful links in the footer. The brand is a link to home and home is also in the menu which is expected by users. In the sign in page, sign-up link is also there incase user has not joined yet for ease of use and vice versa sign-in is on sign-up page.

         ![app footer links](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/footer-links.png)


      3. As a first time visitor, I expect to see an attractive, visually appealing site.<br>
         I have used the same picture and colours all through the site so that there is nothing drastically different that could be off putting. Likewise none of the colours are jarring.<br> Have kept the design fairly simple as the book covers themselves add colours and imagery to the site so didnt want it to look too busy. Following on from that I have limited the number of books per page to 5 using pagination so that too many books aren't overwhelming to the user.<br> Didn't want any gaps in the site from lack of supplied url or a broken link and so supplied a back up image.

         ![app pagination](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/pagination.png)
         ![app alt image](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/display-alt-image.png)

      4. As a first time visitor, I expect an accessible site.<br>
         All links have aria-labels, all images have alt text and icons are aria-hidden. Accessibility scores on lighthouse are 100.

      5. As a first time visitor, I expect the site to look good on my mobile device.<br>
         The site was built with mobile first in mind. I have hidden icons on the buttons for small screens as the buttons were taking up too much real estate. Also the book cover is on top of the book text rather than beside as otherwise the book image would be too small to fully appreciate the covers. But aim was that site would look good on all devices.

         ![mobile view](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/mobile.png)
         ![mobile view about page](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/about.png)
         ![mobile view profile page](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/profile.png)
         ![mobile view sign-in page](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/sign-in.png)
         ![mobile view contact page](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/contact.png)
         ![tablet view](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/tablet.png)
         ![desktop view](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/desktop.png)

      6. As a first time visitor, I want to easily search the books.<br>
         The search bar is at the top of the home page, the user can use it to search for author, book title, books added by a certain user, book series name or genre.

         ![app search bar](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/search-bar.png)

      7. As a first time visitor, I want to easily register.<br>
         There is a nav link in the menu to sign-up, aswell as in the footer, there is also another one on the sign-in page. When there, the registration form is no different from any other online forms and you won't be allowed to submit it without the required information. In addition there are tooltips so that username and password are the correct format.

         ![app register link](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/register-link.png)
         ![app registration form](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/register-form.png)
         ![tooltips](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/tooltips.png)

   - #### Returning Visitor Goals

      1. As a returning visitor, I want to add books to my "bookshelves".<br>
         Next to every book is an 'Add to profile' button, which takes you to the add to profile page where user just has to answer two questions to determine which bookshelf or bookshelves to add book to.

         ![profile-add button](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/profile-add.png)
         ![profile-add form](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/profile-add-form.png)

      2. As a returning visitor, I want to follow on social media so I can hear of any new features.<br>
         Social media links are in the footer of all pages.

         ![app footer links](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/footer-links.png)

      3. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to add books to the applications library.<br>
         Right at the top of the home page, above the library is a large 'Add Book' button which takes user to the add book form
         
         ![add book button](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/add-book.png)
         ![add book form](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/add-book-form.png)
        
      4. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to change my password.<br>
         In the footer on all pages is an 'Edit Account' link, this opens an edit account page which has a collapsible for change password. This is so that the user doesn't feel that if its there they have to fill it in ,which they may if it was part of the main form. 

         ![edit account form](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/edit-account.png)
         ![change password collapsible](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/password-change.png)
        
      5. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to rate the app.<br>
         On contact form which is a nav link in the menu there is a section for rate us where you can select stars out of five.
        
         ![rating stars on contact form](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/rate.png)
         
      6. As a returning visitor, I want to get feedback so I know that something has went through or if i've been redirected, why.<br>
         When the contact form is submitted a submission modal pops up. In addition the user will get an email to acknowledge their message.<br> Also there are flash messages for logging out, moving books in your profile, editing books, genres, users and deleting books, genres and users. There are also flash messages for access e.g trying to access restricted pages, trying to edit a book that you didn't add and trying to perform an action which user is required to be logged in to perform. Others are for username already exists, book already exists in library, log in details don't match records etc.

         ![confirmation modal](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/modal.png)
         ![email acknowledgment](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/email.png)
         ![admin flash](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/admin-flash.png)

         ![logout flash](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/logout-flash.png)

   - #### Frequent Visitor Goals

      1. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to edit a book that I've added to the applications library.<br>
         If the user has added a book to the library, an edit button will be available to the user beside the books they added. This button takes the user to the update book page. The form is prefilled so the user only has to edit the field they want to and not fill everything back in again.

         ![edit book button](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/profile-add.png)
         ![update book form](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/update-book.png)

      2. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to contact the owner with suggestions.<br>
         Contact is a main nav link, this takes the user to the contact form which for logged in users is prefilled with the personal information. The comment box is available for users to submit a comment.

         ![contact form](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/contact.png)

      3. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to move or delete books on my "bookshelves".<br>
         Its easy for a user to move books between bookshelves. Beside each book are buttons, if the user does not own a book then an 'Own' button is there to add it to the 'Books I own' bookshelf if the user then buys it.<br> In the Read books bookshelf, there is a 'Not Read' button which moves it to the 'Books to Read' bookshelf and vice versa. All books have a remove button to delete them from the users profile. 

         ![profile buttons](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/profile-buttons.png)

      4. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to change my account information<br>
         In the footer on all pages is an 'Edit Account' link, this opens an edit account page, they can change all details apart from the username, due to books being connected to the username.

         ![edit account form](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/edit-account.png)

      5. As a frequent visitor, I don't want to have never ending scrolling up or down.<br>
         Made the bookshelves on profile page collapsible as quickly the number of books on all three bookshelves could become lengthy.<br> Added pagination for the library as again the number of books in it will just get longer and can become overwhelming.<br> In the footer of all pages there is a back to top link so user doesn't have to scroll to get back to the menu.

         ![collapsible bookshelved](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/profile.png)
         ![pagination](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/pagination.png)
         ![back to top link](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/footer-links.png)

   - #### Admin goals
      
      1. As admin, I want to be able to add, delete or edit a book.<br>
         For admin one they are logged in they will see the add book button like any other user.
         Admin will have all three buttons beside every book not just the one they themselves have added to library. The admins update user allows admin to update ook title which a normal user cannot.

        ![Add book button](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/add-book.png)
        ![Delete and edit book buttons](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/profile-add.png)

        ![Admin Delete book ](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/admin-delete-book.png)


      2. As admin, I want to be able to add, delete or edit a genre.<br>
         Admin has a manage genre page which is a nav link in their main menu. Here they can edit a genre via a collapsible text box which is prefilled. They can also delete a genre after confirmation. There is also an add genre text input field.

         ![Delete genre and confirmation](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/delete-genre.png)

      3. As admin, I want to be able to delete a user.<br>
         Admin has a mange user page via their menu. Beside each user there is delete button which opens a confirmation collapsible with a cancel if it was a mistake or a delete button to delete the user.

         ![Manage user page showing delete buttons](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/manage-users.png)
         ![Delete user confirmation](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/delete-user.png)
         
      4. As admin, I want to be able to make another user an admin.<br>
         Beside each username on the manage users page there is an edit button, this opens the edit user page which has a switch for turning on admin capabilites for a user.

         ![Update user confirmation](static/images/testing-images/user-stories/update-user.png)


      5. As admin, I want to be able to reset a users password if they're having trouble logging in.<br>
         Beside each username on the manage users page there is an edit button, this opens the edit user page. If a user requests help logging in, the admin can open the reset password in edit user page and make a new password for them. They are then reminded to email user with new password, and they will be told to change it again themselves.
