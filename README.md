# Pocket Bookcase

Here is a link to the live project. ()

This website was created for Milestone 3 - Datacentric Development project, as part of the Code Institutes diploma in Software development.<br>
I love books and have the problem of never remembering what book I'm on in the numerous series that i'm in the middle of reading. This means I often start to read a book I've already read and buy books I already have at home.<br>
I was inspired by an app I used to have which doesn't seem to exist now which was for keeping track of which Terry Pratchett Discworld books that the user had read. It was just a simple list of the books with a checkbox beside them, but it did the trick and I thought how useful it would be to have it for any books.<br>
Upon pitching my idea to a few people, I was met with how useful that would be and how much they would use it, and so Pocket Bookcase was born.

## User Experience (UX)

   ### Strategy 
   - User goals 
     * As a user I want help keeping track of my books.
     * As a user I want to save my money and time by not buying books I already own or have read. 

   - Site owner/ business goals
     * As the site owner I want my site to be responsive to different screen sizes.
     * As the site owner I want my site to be accessible to my visitors.
     * As the site owner I want to build up media presence, to ultimately build up users so that I can earn money from   affiliate links.
     * Ultimately though I want to use the application to track my own books.

   ### User Stories

        1. As a first time visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site. 
        2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to intuitively use the site.

        2. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to contact the owner with suggestions of new genres.
        3. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to move or delete books on my "bookshelves".

        4. As admin, I want to be able to make another user an admin.

   ### Scope

   Within project conception, a list of features were compiled, these were the scored 
   between 1 & 5 for importance and feasibility/ viability which then decided which features 
   could be included for initial launch.    

   #### Current features 

-   Responsive on all device sizes

-   Accessible 

-   Easy to navigate (Single use learning)

-   Interactive elements

-   Social Links (build up media presence)

-   Ability to contact owner 


   #### Features to implement in the future

-   

   ### Structure
-  We start with a landing page with a start button, this then takes the user to the beginning of the options and the timer will start. The user goes through the options until only one is left. The result page is opened, displaying the result, with accompanying picture and short paragraph, some will also have accompanying links or map.<br>
-  The About section is a modal outlining the premise of the game.
-  The contact form I chose to put on its own page instead of a modal as I wanted a decently sized text area for people to write in and to have a confirmation modal to pop up on successful submission.<br>
-  All pages will have nav links to Home, About and Contact at the top and social links at the bottom as this is what users expect to see.<br>

  ### Skeleton 

Wireframes were created on Balsamiq (see links below)

* [Mobile](static/readme-assets/wireframes/ms3-mobile.pdf)
* [Tablet](static/readme-assets/wireframes/ms3-tablet.pdf)
* [Desktop](static/readme-assets/wireframes/ms3-desktop.pdf)

Changes from the wireframes to final site are minimal. 

 ### Surface

 -   #### Colour Scheme
        
        Found a picture for the background image and used that to pick colours from.

## Deployment

 - ### Creation 

    I created this repository by:<br>
    (a) Logging into Github and clicked the green new button.<br>
    (b) This took me to the page below. I selected the code institute template, input a repository name and clicked the 
    green create repository button.<br>

    ![image showing green new button](assets/readme-assets/readme-images/new.png)
    ![Image showing the create repository page](assets/readme-assets/readme-images/new-repo.png)

    (c) Opened new repository and clicked green Gitpod button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

 - ### Github pages
    I deployed my project to Github pages by:

    (a) Logged in to Github and opened my [repository](https://github.com/natalie-kate/date-night)<br>
    (b) From here clicked settings, see picture below and selected pages.

    ![Image showing where pages is in settings](assets/readme-assets/readme-images/pages.png)

    (c) In pages under source branch I selected Master 
           and kept the default root and then clicked save.

    ![Image showing the Github pages options](assets/readme-assets/readme-images/source.png) <br>

    (d) After a minute or two the page has now published and the site address is available in the Github page section.

    ![Image showing that the site has been successfully published](assets/readme-assets/readme-images/published.png)

 - ### Forking
   (a) To fork my project sign in to Github and go to my [repository](https://github.com/natalie-kate/date-night)<br>
   (b) Above and to the right of the settings there are three options and the far right one says Fork, select this.<br>
   (c) The fork is now in your repositories.


 - ### Clone
   To clone my project sign in to Github and go to my [repository](https://github.com/natalie-kate/date-night)<br>
   * Clone using command line
     + Next to the green Gitpod button is a button that says code, select this. There is a few options as to how you 
       would like to clone, if you choose https, SSH or Github CLI, select the clipboard icon to copy the URL.
     + In your workspace that you've created, in the terminal , type git clone, paste the URL and enter.

     ![Image showing the cloning options](assets/readme-assets/readme-images/clone.png)
   * Desktop Github
     + If you choose to clone by selecting open with desktop Github, it will guide you through the clone with prompts.<br>
